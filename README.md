# sw-cad-airframe-lv3.0
This is the repo for the 2016 LV3 capstone. This [will eventually hold] everything you need to know about making a rocket out of carbon fiber.

* PSAS-LV3.0/ holds CAD stuff 
* simulation/ holds OpenRocket stuff. Eventually, CFD stuff will go there too. 

LV3 team members, please add your name to this list, so we know who is able to push to this repository:
* Joe Shields

If you aren't allowed to push, send Andrew your Github username and ask him to give you access. (This is different from getting added to the PSAS "organization".)
