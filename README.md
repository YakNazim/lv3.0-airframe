# sw-cad-airframe-lv3.0
This is the repo for the 2016 LV3 capstone. This [will eventually hold] everything you need to know about making a rocket out of carbon fiber.

* solidworks/ holds CAD stuff 
* simulation/ holds calculation stuff. That includes OpenRocket, OpenFOAM, DATCOM, and the R analysis of that stuff.
* doc/ holds all of the documentation that doesn't fall into those categories.
* testing/ holds the data and analyses from the various tests done on LV3 componenets

LV3 team members, please add your name to this list, so we know who is able to push to this repository:

* Joe Shields

If you aren't allowed to push, send Andrew your Github username and ask him to give you access. (This is different from getting added to the PSAS "organization".)
