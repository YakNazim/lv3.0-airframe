# PSAS Launch Vehicle 3 (LV3) ðŸš€

This is the repo for the LV3 airframe. This holds everything you need to know about making a rocket out of carbon fiber. This includes CAD files, design and prototyping logs, simulation and testing data, most of all the manufacturing procedures for the carbon fiber airframe modules.  

If you aren't allowed to push, send Andrew your Github username and ask him to give you access. (This is different from getting added to the PSAS "organization".)

If you're looking to copy or build on this work check out the [doc directory](/doc/), especially the [layup procedure](/doc/mfg/moduleProcedure.md) and please message the people who have committed frequently/recently with any questions (or better yet, [make an issue with your question](https://github.com/psas/lv3.0-airframe/issues)).

## Todo:
[Check out the issues list if you're looking for something to do.](https://github.com/psas/lv3.0-airframe/issues) This to-do is usually out of date and is meant to give an idea of what needs to happen for the project to progress. If you see something that needs to be added, modified, or checked off, please do so. 

- Fin can
    - [ ] Practice the tip-to-tip on the existing fin can.
	- [X] Cut out the frames (Peter)
	   - [ ] Cut the leading/trailing edges on the frames
	- [ ] Cut out the fin jigs
		- [X] figure out how/where we can manufacture such a large plate (would probably work on @petermccloud's machine!)
	- [ ] Cut out the baseplate.
	- [ ] Try cutting the leading/trailing edges on the weeny fin using the mill in the LID.
	- [ ] Test the fin layup process.
		- [ ] Make a couple CF brackets.
		- [ ] 3D print two tiny ABS fillets.

		- [ ] Do high-temp cure.
	- [ ] MFG first fin can
		- [ ] re-test the fin brackets from the 2014 capstone for feasibility 
	    - [ ] layup test fins (one at a time, until it's good)
		- [ ] layup fins onto fin can
- Nose
	- [ ] Design templates for CF sections
	- [X] do a small-scale test of MFG a composite mold
		- [X] test porosity of a many-layered section
		- [X] test feasability of laying up on sharp corners
		- [X] try making a mold with a layer of gel coat
		- [ ] try another layup in the tiny mold with more release agent
	- [ ] Try a tiny layup with the room-temp materials.
	- [ ] Machine the tip.
	- [ ] Revise the design for the plug.
- MFG procedures
	- [X] Add pictures to the MFG procedures.
	- [X] Review procedures (not Joe)
	- [ ] document problems/decisions relating to the nose mold
- Radome
	- [X] Make a FG layup. 
	- [ ] Perform EM testing
	- [ ] Integration test with cradle
- Modules
    - [ ] sand modules
    	- [ ] Figure out what the best method for sanding is (hand, dremel, orbital, etc.).
    - Surface roughness
        - [ ] Read AIAA paper (not gonna post it. You can email @Joedang if you want it.)
        - [ ] [Read NASA paper](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660028009.pdf)
    - [ ] Make decision (convert black modules? ~~Abandon blue modules?~~)
- [X] AIAA paper
- Miscellaneous
	- [X] Move all deliverable-related things from the Google Drive into this repo. 
	- [ ] Schedule tensile test with Chinh
