# sw-cad-airframe-lv3.0
This is the repo for the 2016 LV3 capstone. This [will eventually hold] everything you need to know about making a rocket out of carbon fiber.

## What and where
* solidWorks/ holds CAD stuff 
* simulation/ holds calculation stuff. That includes OpenRocket, OpenFOAM, DATCOM, and the R analysis of that stuff.
* doc/ holds all of the documentation (updtes, manufacturing procedures, AIAA paper).
* testing/ holds the data and analyses from the various tests done on LV3 componenets

##To do 
- [ ] Move all deliverable-related things from the Google Drive into this repo. 
 	(Which SW models are the final versions?)
- [ ] Bring the procedures for all the manufacturing up to date. 
 	(fin procedures done; need pictures)
- [ ] Prepare machinable foam for CNC milling @ ESCO
- &#x1F34F; Cut block into thirds 
- &#x1F49B; Re-apply resin with **vacuum bagging** & **room temp for 24 hr**
- &#x1F537; Run through whole cure cycle with **vacuum bagging**
- [ ] Try a FG layup. 
 	(happening Sat. 6-18 at 8 am)
- [ ] Figure out how much surface roughness matters.
- [ ] Write first draft of AIAA paper.
- [ ] Layup another set of fins and apply to 24" module.
- [ ] Write up suggestions for future ME PSAS groups to consider during thier project.
