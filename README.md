# sw-cad-airframe-lv3.0
This is the repo for the 2016 LV3 capstone. This [will eventually hold] everything you need to know about making a rocket out of carbon fiber.

## What and where
* solidWorks/ holds CAD stuff 
* simulation/ holds calculation stuff. That includes OpenRocket, OpenFOAM, DATCOM, and the R analysis of that stuff.
* doc/ holds all of the documentation (updtes, manufacturing procedures, AIAA paper).
* testing/ holds the data and analyses from the various tests done on LV3 componenets

##To do 
- [] Move all deliverable-related things from the Google Drive into this repo.
- [] Finish writing the procedures for all the manufacturing.
- [] Fix the machinable foam blocks.
- [] Try a FG layup.
- [] Figure out how much surface roughness matters.
