# sw-cad-airframe-lv3.0
This is the repo for the 2016 LV3 capstone. This [will eventually hold] everything you need to know about making a rocket out of carbon fiber.

## What and where
* cad/ holds CAD stuff (Solidworks files for all of the airframe machined parts)
* sim/ holds calculation stuff. That includes OpenRocket, OpenFOAM, DATCOM, and the R analysis of that stuff.
* doc/ holds all of the documentation (updtes, manufacturing procedures, AIAA paper).
* test/ holds the data and analyses from the various tests done on LV3 componenets

##To do 
- [ ] Move all deliverable-related things from the Google Drive into this repo. 
 	- [ ] Find out which SW models are the final versions.
	- [X] Clean up existing CAD files.
- [ ] Bring the procedures for all the manufacturing up to date. 
	- [X] Write all the necessary steps
	- [ ] Add pictures to the MFG procedures.
- [ ] Prepare machinable foam for CNC milling at ESCO
	- [X] Cut block into thirds 
	- [X] Re-apply resin with **vacuum bagging** & **room temp for 24 hr**
	- [ ] Run through whole cure cycle with **vacuum bagging**
	- [ ] Deliver foam blocks to Esco.
- [ ] Make a radome
	- [X] Make a FG layup. 
	- [ ] Perform EM testing
	- [ ] Crush the FG layup
- [ ] Figure out how much surface roughness matters.
- [ ] AIAA paper
	- [ ] Write first draft of AIAA paper.
- [ ] Finish the fin cans.
	- [ ] Do the tip-to-tip on the existing fin can.
	- [ ] Layup 3 more fins.
	- [ ] Attach new fins to the remaining 24" module.
	- [ ] Do tip-to-tip on the new fin can.
- [ ] Write up suggestions for future ME PSAS groups to consider during thier project. 

## Relavant Deadlines
* AIAA paper: August. 18 8pm EST (hard deadline; submit before this)
* Rocket launch: August 19 ([with OROC](http://www.oregonrocketry.com/?page_id=54))
