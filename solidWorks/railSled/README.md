This is the part that holds the rocket onto the rail during launch. 
It's meant to adhere to the side of the fin can.
We currently don't have much of a plan to align it.
The CAD and CAM are done. (CAM to be added soon.)
The first try at machining the aluminum base didn't turn out well...
If you're coming back and looking at the CAD files, don't judge too harshly. This was one of the first real parts I made in Solidworks.
