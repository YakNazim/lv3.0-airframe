Lengthwise CoMs were determined by the following.
- A 1" diameter HDPE bar stock was taped to a table. 
- A yard stick was placed on the table. 
- The center of the bar stock was aligned to the 20" mark, with the bar stock perpendicular to the yard stick),
- The flight article was placed on the bar stock and adjusted until it balanced freely. (Gentle touches were necessary to stabilize it.)
- A suitable feature was sighted along the yard stick and its distance from the bar stock was recorded.
