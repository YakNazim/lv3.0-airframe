# General Tools for Making the LV3 Airframe
This directory only contains general tools. 
To a large extent, the designs found here would be useful for *any* composites work. 
Many stages of the airframe manufacturing process require specialized tools that are only applicable to one part of the airframe.
You will find those designs along side the CAD files for their respective parts in the [cad/](../cad/) directory.
