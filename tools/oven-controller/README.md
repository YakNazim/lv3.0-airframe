oven-controller
===============
This is kind of a dumpster fire. It was clearly its own repo at some point and somebody downloaded the ZIP for that repo and just plopped it here. There's a completely different version of the software as made by the 2014 capstone team versus the CS student. The CS version uses deprecated Arduino libraries and focuses *way* more on making a fancy GUI than a functional tool. 

We don't even have this oven at PSU anymore. We replaced it with a commercial oven for legal reasons. My advice: _**if you want to build a temperature controlled oven, just buy a commercial controller!**_ 
You can get constant-temp controllers off of Amazon for 20 to 30 USD and ramping/soaking controllers (exactly what you need!) off of ebay for like 80 USD.

For the composites oven team at Portland State. 

v0 - the original schematic representation of the current working breadboard setup.

v1 - the finished Arduino shield version on a printed circuit board. this works! 

v2 - additions to the v1 Arduino shield design.

v3 - developing final version for OSHPark order.
