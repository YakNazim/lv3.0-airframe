The amateur and university rocketry communities are rapidly reaching higher altitudes with more sophisticated rockets. However, most groups are still using heavy airframes made of metal or fiberglass. Commercial off-the-shelf airframes are either too expensive for low-budget university groups or too small to use as a platform for high altitude experiments. 
A capstone team of mechanical engineering seniors at Portland State University has developed a low-weight, modular carbon fiber airframe as an open-hardware technology for university rocketry. 
This project continues the work of a 2014 capstone team, who developed a carbon fiber layup process with promising results. 
This will enable low-budget groups like the Portland State Aerospace Society to explore high altitude science and compete in the university space race.

	The CF (1) is bonded to the honeycomb core (3) and the aluminum coupling ring (4) using structural adhesive (2). 
	The adhesive also serves as a protective coating for the CF and provides a smooth outer surface. 
	See figure \ref{fig:coupon} for a picture of this design.
