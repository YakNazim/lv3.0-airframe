    "## Cubesat Frame Mount, Design Specifications\n",
    "This document serves to collect all of the electrical and mechanical design constraints in one place. The constaints are broken up into mechanical, electrical, and Misc. requirements. Mechanical refers to any structural restrictions as well as the physical forces that the assembly will endure. The electrical constraints are any EM restrictions, wiring location requirements, and any other requirements that do not directly translate to a mechanical requirement. Misc. requirements are meant for anything that does not fall into either category, since there might be something I am forgetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the requirements are broken up into 'must' and 'should'. The 'must' requirements will be prioritized, while the 'should' requirements are relegated to quality-of-life improvements and such.\n",
