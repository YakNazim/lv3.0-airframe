    "## Cubesat Frame Mount, Design Specifications\n",
    "This document serves to collect all of the electrical and mechanical design constraints in one place. The constaints are broken up into mechanical, electrical, and Misc. requirements. Mechanical refers to any structural restrictions as well as the physical forces that the assembly will endure. The electrical constraints are any EM restrictions, wiring location requirements, and any other requirements that do not directly translate to a mechanical requirement. Misc. requirements are meant for anything that does not fall into either category, since there might be something I am forgetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the requirements are broken up into 'must' and 'should'. The 'must' requirements will be prioritized, while the 'should' requirements are relegated to quality-of-life improvements and anything that is not a main priority.\n",

    "Please feel free to populate the useful links and contact information.\n",

    "If the design constraint was met, it is marked with a [Y], and if it was not met it is marked with a [N]. If they are not met, a note is added.\n",

    "## Design Notes\n",
    "The overall design, shown in *figure 1*, consists of four main components. The rail system is what houses the 3U+ CubeSat, along with all other electronics surrounding the CubeSat. The rail to ring interface serves to mount the rail carriage to the rings. The two rings serve to carry all connections to the rest of the rocket, along with the interface to the other modules. The six plates that surround the rails serve to add torsional strength and mark the location of the 1U and 2U CubeSat locations. All components besides the rail to ring interface are made out of acrylic laser cut using the MELT 60W.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Figure 1]: LINK.png \"Rail System CAD\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mounting Plates:\n",
    "The aluminum mounting discs are screwed into the six radial holes already present on the module rings. The 'closed' acrylic plates are screwed to the aluminum rings using the eight mounting holes. These holes also allow the entire center assembly to be screwed to the end mounting plates as well as the laser cut plates to be bolted together for easier alignment when making small changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rail System:\n",
    "The rails themselves are made of acrylic ahered together using [this adhesive](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0096TWKCW/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_awd_x_78E1xbM2E4X0B). The rails contact the CubeSat rails across the entire length of the CubeSat, while also being adhered to the plates with the square openings shown in *figure 1*. The four plates located at the 1U and 2U distances from the base are adhered as well to ensure improved torsional strength."
