    "## Cubesat Frame Mount, Design Specifications\n",
    "This document serves to collect all of the electrical and mechanical design constraints in one place. The constaints are broken up into mechanical, electrical, and Misc. requirements. Mechanical refers to any structural restrictions as well as the physical forces that the assembly will endure. The electrical constraints are any EM restrictions, wiring location requirements, and any other requirements that do not directly translate to a mechanical requirement. Misc. requirements are meant for anything that does not fall into either category, since there might be something I am forgetting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the requirements are broken up into 'must' and 'should'. The 'must' requirements will be prioritized, while the 'should' requirements are relegated to quality-of-life improvements and anything that is not a main priority.\n",

    "## Design Notes\n",
    "The overall design, shown in *figure 1*, consists of four main components. The rail system is what houses the 3U+ CubeSat, along with all other electronics surrounding the CubeSat. The rail to ring interface serves to mount the rail carriage to the rings. The two rings serve to carry all connections to the rest of the rocket, along with the interface to the other modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Figure 1]: LINK.png \"Rail System CAD\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rail System:\n",
    "The rail system consists of a 9 member truss (on each side) that allows fastening of the CubeSat by hand. This is done by using a two-plate friction assembly using binding posts and two plates. An alternative to this is using a [square U-bolt](http://www.mcmaster.com/#u-bolts/=13jzetv). This allows the mount to be adjusted for any size CubeSat. The main issue with using a U-bolt is finding one that measures only 1/4\" in width.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CubeSat:\n",
    "The CubeSat will potentially be printed on an MJP-2500 printer from 3D Systems. This will allow very fine features with modest material properties."
