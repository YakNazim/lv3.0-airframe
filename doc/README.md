Here's a whole bunch of stuff you can read on composites and LV3. The must-read stuff is in bold. 
For someone doing a carbon fiber capstone, this is in rough order of importance. 

* _[LV3 Narrative]_
	* This provides its own description. I specifically wrote it to benefit whomever did the next CF capstone, so you should definitely read it. Hopefully it's not too preachy. 
* _[2014 "textbook" on composites]_
	* This does a pretty good job of covering the basic ideas, techniques, and terminology for making composites. Definitely read the whole thing.
* _[LV3 manufacturing docs]_
	* This is the really important stuff, especially this. If you read anything read this! Some of the pictures are missing, so pester me to add them if it's confusing. 
* _[LV3 capstone updates]_
	* This is my bi-weekly-ish account of the capstone. Not all of it will be relevant to you guys, but it's good context. It contains a lot (if not all) of the critical information from the LV3 capstone. So, it would be a good idea to thoroughly read it if you get stuck.
* [2014 "documentation"]
	* This is actually just all of the stuff created by the 2014 team dumped into one PDF, including all their emails. I don't recommend reading the emails. There's too many of them to actually retain any information. Skim/read the front and end matter, so you know what they did. If you get stuck at some point in your project, try to Ctrl-F for related terms in this thing for clues... That actually worked for us more than once.
* [2016 google drive]
	* Similar to the above thing, this is a pathologically organized heap of information from my capstone. You might get lucky and find something you need there. This also contains a similar Google drive dump from the 2014 team.
* [LV3 future directive]
	* An incomplete document. It's so short that you might as well read it.
* [AIAA paper]
	* There's nothing in there you won't get from the other documents. It's also mostly focused on the testing stuff from the 2016 capstone. And let me be totally clear, relearning how to manufacture the modules was the vast majority of the work in that capstone. Testing and design was comparatively small.
