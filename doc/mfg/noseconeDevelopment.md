# A Guide to / Journal of the Mold Making Processes Used on LV3

### A Note On Safety
The materials and procedures described below require more elaborate safety precautions than those used in the standard modules.
**_Always_ read the directions and MSDS/SDS for each material. If you're not sure if a safety measure is necessary, it is.**
Make sure you understand the hazards present, how to protect yourself, and what to do in case of an accident **before** starting. 
Don't assume the precautions in this guide are complete. Your safety is your own responsibility. 

## The Nosecone Mold

### Design and Materials Choice
We went through a lot of different options for how to make the mold for the nosecone. The main problem with it is that it's so large (6.6" diameter, ~40" long). On top of that, whatever process we used needed to be scalable to LV4, since that's what LV3 is the test platform for.
To add to that, we needed something that would work at 350 F, the temperature that the prepreg cures at. So we couldn't use wood, machinable wax, or any common foams. We considered using aluminum, but that would be prohibitively expensive to source and machine -- that's an absurdly large piece of aluminum to machine. 
The requirement for high temperature curing prepreg comes from the Mach heating LV4 will experience. (LV3 won't experience more than about 180 F. We also happen to have a lot of that material thanks to a donation from Boeing.) 


We settled on using high temperature machinable foam. This is $400 for a sheet that can be cut and laminated into blocks for 3 molds or plugs. 
We originally tried laminating these using weights to hold the layers together. Unfortunately the layers warped and did not fully adhere. 
Later, we poured epoxy into the delaminated sections and cured it again in a vacuum bag. **It is strongly recommended that you use a vacuum bag when laminating sheets of machinable foam!** The large area of the sheets provides a much greater force than can be reasonably achieved with weights.

### Making the Plug
The first of the blocks was machined with donated time from Esco. It was sealed with high-temp epoxy, but we vacuum bagged it, which created large wrinkles and bubbles on the inside surface of the mold. 
We applied wax and PVA mold release to this mold and tried laying up a single layer of CF anyways. When the mold was cooling, it contracted more than the CF. Thus, the CF pushed out on the ends of the mold, breaking off the front of the mold.

The second of the blocks was machined in the science machine shop. This was sealed with epoxy with no vacuum bag. 
To avoid the problems of the last mold, the epoxy was wiped with a paper shop towel, forming a thin, rough layer.
As before, we mold-released this and laid up a 2-layer CF shell. The CF shell ended up bonding to the mold and breaking it in two during the cool-down.
This was attributed to the thin layers of wax and PVA mold release used, and the rough surface of the mold.

After testing a smaller version, The third and final block was machined on Peter McCloud's mill (a PSAS member). This was sealed with epoxy (again, no vac-bag) and mold-released. 
The shape of the plug, as opposed to the mold, allowed the epoxy coating to be done by simply painting on a thick layer of epoxy and letting it flow down. This made the surface much smoother and more consistent.

### Making the Mold
The plug was coated in two thick layers of wax mold release and two layers of PVA release. The first layer of the mold was wax-free gel coat. This is a room-temp curing polyester resin which fills in/over sharp corners in plug/mold. (If you just start laying composites onto the plug, you will get voids in the surface of your mold.)
The fumes from the gel coat are extremely harmful. Anyone participating in this part of the layup should wear respirator intended to filter out volatile organic compounds as well as splash goggles. 
If you can do this part of the layup under a fume hood or snorkels, do so!

#### Layup

#### Demolding


## The Nosecone
We tried two different procedures for manufacturing the nosecone. 
The first was to layup in each shell simultaneously, clamp the molds together, overlap the layers of the nosecone shell, and inflate a balloon inside the mold to apply compacting pressure to the lamina. 
The second was to layup two shells individually with a vacuum bag for compaction, bond the shells together via the aluminum hardware, and patch the seams with strips of CF.
The second method was successful, but labor-intensive.

### Single-Cure layup

#### Mold prep
Each mold was coated with two layers of paste wax. 
The first layer was wiped on with a towel, pressing firmly to fill in any defects.
After allowing the solvent in the first layer to flash off over night. 
The second layer was applied with a lighter touch, filling in any cracks in the first layer. 
It's important to apply the second layer quickly, without pressing firmly. 
Otherwise, the first layer can slough off as the solvent in the second layer diffuses into it. 
The second layer was allowed to dry overnight.

The molds were placed together and aligned as they would be for the final layup.
They flat portions of the molds were lightly clamped together. 
Registration marks were made around the perimeter of the molds and uniquely labelled.
(Each mold had marks labelled alphabetically, which corresponded to a labelled mark on the other mold.)

#### Lamination
Four sheets of 20 oz. twill weave CF were rough cut, two for each half-shell. 
The stock fabric was draped over the back of the molds to check its size (roughly 48 by 12 inches).
Two sections of 1/4 inch over-expanded Nomex, 12 by 8 inches, were cut.
The 8 inch dimension must be in the over-expanded direction. 

A 60 g batch of epoxy (F-2400) was spread on the inside of the molds (60 g total, averaging 30 g each).
A CF sheet was placed in each mold and pressed down with rollers.
The edges were trimmed so that the + theta side formed a 1 inch flange and the other was flush with the side of the mold. 
The tip and tail edges were cut flush.
The flange was tapered to be smaller near the tip.

The mess created by the cut-off CF was a problem, but manageable. 

Another 60 g batch of epoxy was mixed and spread over the 8 inch section in the tail end of the molds.
The Nomex sheets were placed in the mold and cut to have a 1.5 inch flange on the + theta side.

TODO: look up the actual flange lengths used. Finish this section on the laminations.

#### Joining
Both flanges were folded in before joining the molds.
The molds were brought together and loosely clamped. The alignment of the molds was tweaked until all the registration marks lined up.
Then, the mold was clamped more securely. 
The flanges of the two shells were folded over according to the diagram.  
TODO: make a diagram of the flange layers. It should already exist in my physical notes. -- Joe  
A yard stick with a brush screwed to the end was used to fold over the layers near the tip of the nosecone, since that area could not be reached by hand.
