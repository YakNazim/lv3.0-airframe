## The Nosecone Mold

### Design and Materials Choice
We went through a lot of different options for how to make the mold for the nosecone. The main problem with it is that it's so large (6.6" diameter, ~40" long). On top of that, whatever process we used needed to be scalable to LV4, since that's what LV3 is the test platform for.
To add to that, we needed something that would work at 350 F, the temperature that the prepreg cures at. So we couldn't use wood, machinable wax, or any common foams. We considered using aluminum, but that would be prohibitively expensive to source and machine -- that's an absurdly large piece of aluminum to machine. 
The requirement for high temperature curing prepreg comes from the Mach heating LV4 will experience. (LV3 won't experience more than about 180 F. We also happen to have a lot of that material thanks to a donation from Boeing.) 


We settled on using high temperature machinable foam. This is $400 for a sheet that can be cut and laminated into blocks for 3 molds or plugs. 
We originally tried laminating these using weights to hold the layers together. Unfortunately the layers warped and did not fully adhere. 
Later, we poured epoxy into the delaminated sections and cured it again in a vacuum bag. **It is strongly recommended that you use a vacuum bag when laminating sheets of machinable foam!** The large area of the sheets provides a much greater force than can be reasonably achieved with weights.

### Making the Plug
The first of the blocks was machined with donated time from Esco. It was sealed with high-temp epoxy, but we vacuum bagged it, which created large wrinkles and bubbles on the inside surface of the mold. 
We applied wax and PVA mold release to this mold and tried laying up a single layer of CF anyways. When the mold was cooling, it contracted more than the CF. Thus, the CF pushed out on the ends of the mold, breaking off the front of the mold.

The second of the blocks was machined in the science machine shop. This was sealed with epoxy with no vacuum bag. 
To avoid the problems of the last mold, the epoxy was wiped with a paper shop towel, forming a thin, rough layer.
As before, we mold-released this and laid up a 2-layer CF shell. The CF shell ended up bonding to the mold and breaking it in two during the cool-down.
This was attributed to the thin layers of wax and PVA mold release used, and the rough surface of the mold.

After testing a smaller version, The third and final block was machined on Peter McCloud's mill (a PSAS member). This was sealed with epoxy (again, no vac-bag) and mold-released. 
The shape of the plug, as opposed to the mold, allowed the epoxy coating to be done by simply painting on a thick layer of epoxy and letting it flow down. This made the surface much smoother and more consistent.

### Making the Mold
The plug was coated in two thick layers of wax mold release and two layers of PVA release. The first layer of the mold was wax-free gel coat. This is a room-temp curing polyester resin which fills in/over sharp corners in plug/mold. (If you just start laying composites onto the plug, you will get voids in the surface of your mold.)
The fumes from the gel coat are extremely harmful. Anyone participating in this part of the layup should wear respirator intended to filter out volatile organic compounds as well as splash goggles. 
If you can do this part of the layup under a fume hood or snorkels, do so!
