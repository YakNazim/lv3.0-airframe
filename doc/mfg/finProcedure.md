# LV3 Fin Manufacturing Procedure

This is the step-by-step for creating fins for the LV3 airframe and attaching them to a module. 
Currently, there are "only" enough aluminum slabs to manufacture two fins at a time, so don't try to prep three fins at a time...

## Preparation
1. Put on powderless nitrile gloves. If you gloves get dirty, greasy, etc., replace them. Even if you don't care about your health, you still need to keep your skin oil off of the layup!
1. Lightly sand the CF-bonding surfaces of the fins frames (the slight depression on the edge of the ) using 600 grit sand paper.
1. Clean the fins by wiping them with an acetone soaked shop towel until no residue comes off on the towel. 
1. Continuously apply part A of the anti-galvanic treatment to the CF-bonding surfaces for 4 minutes.
1. Wait 10 minutes.
1. Continuously apply part D of the anti-galvanic treatment to the CF-bonding surfaces for 4 minutes.
1. Wait 1 hour.

	1. Cut out the appropriate nomex sections from tamplates (use the male templates). You will end up cutting some sections that don't snugly fit into the frames. Cut some redundant sections and use the ones that fit. They should stay in the frame when it is picked up and turned around. You may need to cut them slightly larger than the templates to accomplish this.
	1. Cut out the sections of CF and adhesive. Note that they use slightly different templates. Take care to cut the CF so that the fibers are alligned to the root and tip edges of the fin. It's helpful to place a weight on one half of the template, make your cut, place a weight on the half you just cut, remove the first weight, and then finish the cut. The sharp angles of these peices may slide around underneath the template otherwise.
	1. While the adhesive is cold (put it in the freezer for a half minute, if you need to), partially separate the paper and plastic backings from the adhesive sheets you just cut. An awl works *very* well for this. Fold the partially removed backing, for easy removal later.
1. Arrange the nomex sections in a fin frame. If there are any gaps between the nomex and the frame much larger than a nomex cell, you will need to replace that nomex section.

## Slab-fin-slab assembly
1. Place the fin frame on an aluminum slab with the flange pressed up against the edge of the slab. 
1. Lightly tape the flange to the slab to prevent slipping. 
1. Remove the red plastic backing on an adhesive sheet. (leave the plastic backing on)
1. Carefully place and allign an adhesive section on the frame. Take care that there is an even gap between the adhesive section and the edge of the lip.
1. Press your hands gently on the adhesive section, tacing it in place with your body heat.
1. Remove one sheet of plastic backing from a CF sheet.
1. Carefully place and allign the CF sheet on the frame. There will be no gap between the CF and the lip. Take care not to force the CF down into the frame at the root.
1. Use hand heat to tac down the CF to the adhesive. 
1. Remove the remaining plastic backing from the CF sheet. 
1. Lay a sheet of nonperforated release film over the CF. 
1. Gently smooth out the release film to eliminate creases and folds. 
1. Carefully place an aluminum slab down on the fin, just ahead of the flange.
1. Slowly slide the aluminum slab to make contact with the flange. 
1. Tape the flange to the upper alumium slab. 
1. Slide the assembly to the corner of the work bench so that the ends of the aluminum slabs are hanging off, taking care not to let them slide relative to the fin.
1. Clamp the two slabs together. Tighten both clamps simultaneously, so the upper slab doesn't tilt.
1. Flip the assembly over and remove the clamps.
1. Cut the tape on what is now the upper slab, so that it doesn't pull up the fin when you remove it.
1. Remove the upper slab. 
1. Repeat the above procedure for the exposed face of the fin:
	1. Apply adhesive
	1. Apply CF
	1. Apply release film
	1. Place a slab on the fin
	1. Tape the slab to the flange.

## Completing the assembly
1. Place the assembly in the oven, taking care to prevent the slabs from sliding relative to the fin.
1. Slide a slab under the tip of the fin protruding from the assembly. Take extra care to prevent the fin from sliding around in the assembly.
1. Place two spacers around the fin on the top of the slab you just placed.
1. Repeat the above steps to create another slab-fin-slab assembly.
1. Carefully place the new assembly on top of the spacers so that the lower slab of the new assembly is flush with the upper slab of the old assembly. Be very careful that neither of the fin flanges unseat from their slabs. 
1. Place two spacers around the tip of the new fin, on the top of the top flange of the first fin. 

## Cooking
1. Place a slab on top of those spacers. Be careful you don't unseat the second fin flange from its slabs. 
1. Place the tip of a \[calibrated\] thermocouple into one of the gaps created by the fins/spacers. The thermal inertia of the slabs will make the temperature of the fins lag behind the temperature of the oven. They will also make the ramp-up process much longer. 
1. Close the oven and begin the cure cycle. 
	1. 3 degrees F per minute ramp up (The oven won't actually be able to manage this.)
	1. 350 degree F hold for 2 hours
	1. Turn the oven off and open the doors.
	1. Wait until the oven declines to a "safe" temperature (100 degree F air temperature)
	1. Close the oven doors and come back tomorrow to open the fins.

Since the temperature of the fins lags behind the air temperature of the oven, you'll want to set the oven about 40 degrees F above the prescribed temperature and then set it back to the prescribed temperature when the temperature of the fins is 10 degrees below what's described. (The point of this is to try and pre-empt the heat propagation through the slabs.) 
If you are impatient and take the fins out of the slabs too early, they will experience large differential thermal expansion, and can develop warping. 

## Fin Attachment
Once the fis are cooked, they will need to be attached to a module. 

1. Sand the inside surface of the fin flanges with 600 grit sandpaper.
1. Clean the inside surface of the flanges with an acetone soaked shop towel until no residue comes off on the towel.
1. Continuously apply part A of the anti-galvanic treatment to the inner surface of the flanges for 4 minutes.
1. Wait 10 minutes.
1. Continuously apply part D of the anti-galvanic treatment to the inner surface of the flanges for 4 minutes.
1. Wait 1 hour.
