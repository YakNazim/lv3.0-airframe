% Hello

\begin{abstract}
The amateur and university rocketry communities are rapidly reaching higher altitudes with more sophisticated rockets. However, most groups are still using heavy airframes made of metal or fiberglass. Commercial off-the-shelf airframes are either too expensive for low-budget university groups or too small to use as a platform for high altitude experiments. 
A capstone team of mechanical engineering seniors at Portland State University has developed a low-weight, modular carbon fiber airframe as an open-hardware technology for university rocketry. 
This project continues the work of a 2014 capstone team, who developed a carbon fiber layup process with promising results. 
This will enable low-budget groups like the Portland State Aerospace Society to explore high altitude science and compete in the university space race.  \end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
%REMEMBER TO SPECIFY ALL ACRONYMS/INITIALISMS!

\end{wrapfigure}

The Portland State Aerospace Society (PSAS) is an interdisciplinary group of engineering students and alumni of Portland State University (PSU) with the long term goal of putting a cubesat into orbit with their own rocket. 
% info about cubesat market growth: http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=44940 
Their current airframe, named Launch Vehicle 2 (LV2), has served for over 12 years, representing 10 of the group's 13 launches, and hosted experiments ranging from custom patch antennas and long range WiFi technology to GPS navigation and a cold gas reaction control system (figure \ref{fig:L-12}). The LV2 platform is mostly constructed of aluminum with a fiberglass shell, with many of the parts having been fabricated in home garages. This makes for a robust but heavy design. Additionally, this airframe is built with a 4.5 inch inner diameter which PSAS's experiments have outgrown. 

The new airframe being designed, named Launch Vehicle 3 (LV3), aims to address these issues. The LV3 platform uses a 6 inch inner diameter, modules composed of carbon fiber and thin aluminum coupling rings, a carbon fiber nose cone, and a carbon fiber fin section. All of the airframe components connect via standardized rings, to accommodate future experimental modules and flight configurations.
The cylindrical LV3 airframe modules outperform the old design with an \weightReduction{} reduction in weight.
% Do we know what the increase in strength is? Also, can we confirm the weight reduction?

\subsection{Basic Design}

The majority of the LV3 airframe uses a sandwich shell composed of CF faces surrounding an aramid honeycomb core (see figure \ref{fig:moduleDiagram}). This provides a rigid structure while minimizing weight. 
Single sheets of carbon fiber are rigid when subjected to in-plane loading, and very flexible in bending. Meanwhile, the core is flexible in bending, and rigid under out-of-plane loading. 
When laminated together, these form a plate which is rigid in all loading conditions. The core material separates the rigid CF faces, greatly increasing the second moment of inertia of the plate. 
There is much more to the theory of sandwich plates and beams, but that is outside the scope of this paper. 

The body of the airframe is composed of modular cylindrical sections using this sandwich design with aluminum coupling rings co-molded to each end.
Each module can hold avionics, experiments, or other equipment with six tapped holes around the inside of the female coupling ring. 
For the radio module, FG takes the place of the CF to allow radio transparency.

The fins use the same sandwich design, with an aluminum frame defining their planform. The center of the frame is filled with core material, and the whole surface is covered in carbon fiber. 
The leading and trailing edges of the fins are made of machined phenolic resin, co-bonded with the frame and CF faces. 
The fins are fins are attached to a module with epoxy fillets, using chopped CF as a filler, and ``tip-to-tip'' CF sheets running from the tip of one fin across the module to the tip of the other fin.

The nose cone uses the same coupling ring system as the modules. It is a von K\'arm\'an ogive formed from two molded CF shells. 
Unlike the rest of the airframe, the nose cone uses a thin shell of two CF sheets, rather than a sandwich design (see section \ref{sec:noseCone} for details). 
The tip of the nose cone is machined out of aluminum and is removed when assembling the recovery system inside the nose cone.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Significance}
Many amateur and university rocketry groups use composite airframes. However, these designs use many layers of fabric, with low fiber volume fractions.
While easy and durable, this does not fully take advantage of their materials. The LV3 design achieves a much higher specific strength and rigidity, enabling greater altitudes with a given motor. 

This design also occupies an uncommon regime for sandwich shell designs. Most such designs use sandwich shells in large, low curvature parts, whereas the LV3 modules have a relatively small size and high curvature.

This is also the only fully open-hardware rocket airframe in the HPR level 3 range. All of the documentation, design, and testing information if freely available on PSAS's Github page \cite{LV3repo}.
%----------need to make extra-sure there aren't any other open-hardware airframes out there----------

\subsection{Software}
\subsubsection{OpenRocket}
For the early design of amateur and university-scale rockets, \href{http://openrocket.sourceforge.net/}{OpenRocket} is very useful. 
It is an open-source Java application which simulates a rocket's flight. It provides a convenient interface for configuring the rocket, selecting commercial or custom parts, viewing the predictions, and performing some basic optimization. 

Using OpenRocket to guide the initial design allowed for rapid iteration of the fin geometry and the placement of non-airframe components. 

\subsubsection{OpenFOAM}
OpenFOAM is another open-source application. It provides a common interface for a wide range of CFD solvers.
Although it requires more up-front effort, it allows a more detailed perspective on what features of an airframe's geometry are the most critical. 
CFD analysis is probably not necessary for most amateur and university level airframe design, but this provides a good option for groups that can't afford a licence for a commercial CFD suite. 

OpenFoam was used to asses the heating at the tip of the nose, to determine if the epoxy matrix of the carbon fiber would degrade over repeated flights.


\section{Materials}
% Joe: I thought this section should talk about the materials that were donated i.e.: Meltbond 1515, Cytec Carbon Fiber, Non-silicone paste wax, etc and save the how we got it for the aquisition section. What do you think?
Nearly all of the materials used in the LV3 airframe were donated. The pre-impregnated CF and the structural adhesive were made available after they expired for use in commercial aircraft. 
Acquiring expired materials from large manufacturers and distributors is the strongly preferred over purchasing them outright or simply using cheaper materials. 
Distributors are unlikely to offer these materials in quantities appropriate to this type of project. 
Using carbon fiber cloth with painted-on epoxy could change the manufacturing significantly, and would increase the weight of the airframe. 
Acquiring donations is also a good way for university groups to form industry contacts. It can even become an opportunity to collaborate with other university groups, through the re-donation of excess material. 

The CF is a plain weave design that is pre-impregnated with epoxy resin which cures at $\SI{350}{\Far}$.
Meanwhile, the adhesive is an epoxy film which cures between $\SI{250}{\Far}$ and $\SI{350}{\Far}$, intended for bonding metals and composites. 
This allows for co-curing of both materials together. The core material is an over-expanded honeycomb Nomex$^\mathregistered$ mat which bonds well to the adhesive.
Finally, the coupling rings are machined out of 6061-T6 aluminum. 

Any groups obtaining materials through donations will likely not have much control over what materials they get, let alone be able to obtain the exact same materials listed here.
As such, any potential donations should be researched before they are accepted and tested afterwards. 
Any weave of CF will work, though satin is preferred. Pre-impregnated CF should be tacky at room temperature.
Adhesive should either be tacky at room temperature or become tacky when heated. Ideally, it should flow at higher temperatures. 
The core material for the modules should be over-expanded or under-expanded. 
Optimally expanded honeycomb cannot be used for the modules, since it ``potato chips'', bending away from the module along the axis when it is bent around the circumference. 
The fin core material may use any cell shape and should be $\nicefrac{1}{8}''$ or smaller. 
%---------check what the preferred notation is for length (fractional inches, decimal inches, centimeters...)---------

\subsection{Acquisition}
% Joe: I cannot think of anything else to add to this section after editing it. 
The open source nature of PSAS and the LV3 project meant that operations rely heavily on the donations of individuals in the community and local industry. Composite materials in the quantity needed to build a complete rocket required funding which was far outside of the means of the PSAS budget. Large composite manufacturers and aerospace companies were contacted about interest in donating expired materials or potential sponsorships. 

Strong industry relationships were built creating reliable sources for materials for the time being and into the future. A substantial source of the material donations made during the composite airframe project was made by Boeing. They supplied PSAS with two rolls of pre-impregnated carbon fiber, structural adhesive, vacuum bagging kits made up of hight temperature bagging material, release film, tape, and breather material. Additionally, Boeing also provided professional consulting with industry experts who made time available to us on a weekly basis. 

Boeing and Pacific Coast Composites donated several rolls of 250°F and 350°F pre-impregnated fiberglass of which Portland State could not supply appropriate storage for. Rolls were dispersed through the campus and local companies offered cold storage in trade for material. This prompted contacting other universities in the region to offer the excess materials as a donation to their clubs. PSAS donated tens of thousands of dollars in fiberglass to Oregon State University and Washington State University's aerospace and motor sports clubs. 

\section{Cylindrical Modules}\label{sec:modules}

		\caption{A fiberglass module after failing in compression. Note that the failure on the inner and outer layers occured at the same height. The male end is shown.}
		\label{fig:crush}
	}
\end{figure}

Each module has a male coupling ring on the end facing the direction of travel and a female coupling ring on the other end. 
Modules were made in both $18''$ and $24''$ lengths, to accommodate different lengths of motors and equipment. 
By exchanging modules of different lengths, this also allows the overall length of the rocket to be adjusted in increments of $6''$.
The body of the module consists of two concentric CF tubes separated by a honeycomb core, with adhesive bonding the CF to the core and rings (see figure \ref{fig:moduleDiagram}). 
A layer of adhesive also covers the outer layer of CF, serving three roles. First, it ensures the outer layer of CF is completely wetted. 
The pre-impregnated CF used here did not completely wet when cured alone, however this will not be true for every product.
Second, it serves as a protective coating for the CF. 
Third, it can be sanded to improve the surface roughness.
Using a profilometer, the surface features of the uncoated modules was found to be $\SI{179}{\micro\meter}$ ($\SI{7.1e-3}{in}$), while the surface features of the adhesive-coated modules could be sanded to $\SI{3.3}{\micro\meter}$ ($\SI{1.3e-4}{in}$).

\end{figure}

The modules are formed by wrapping the layers around a male mandrel with the coupling rings secured to the mandrel.
The coupling rings are each screwed to a dummy ring which emulates a connection to another module. The dummy rings are then screwed to the mandrel.
This prevents any shifting during the cure due to thermal expansion or compaction from the vacuum bag and shrink tape (discussed later).
The coupling rings are also chemically treated before the layup to prevent galvanic corrosion with the CF.
A layer of release film is used to prevent the inner layer of CF from adhering to the mandrel. 
The adhesive layers naturally adhere to the CF layers with body heat from gloved hands, but a heat gun is required for adhering to the core. 
The core is compressed significantly in the circumferential direction and slightly in the axial direction to compensate for thermal expansion. This helps prevent grooves from forming at the edges of the core.

The entire layup is wrapped in shrink tape. Non-perforated, release-coated tape is preferred, but perforated tape is necessary if the adhesive or epoxy used outgasses.
The shrink tape compacts the module, strengthening the bond between the CF and core while also flattening any irregularities in the surface of the module. 
After curing, the outer layer of adhesive is sanded and polished to obtain a smooth surface, completing the module.

\subsection{Destructive Testing}

\begin{wraptable}{R}{4.5 in}
	\centering
	\caption{Failure strengths for different modules.}\label{tab:compression}
	% this should probably be given in Newtons with pounds being parenthetical
	\begin{tabular}{llll}
		Material & Loading & Pinging Strength & Ultimate Strength\\
		\hline
		CF 		& axial 	& $\SI{7e3}{\poundF}$ 	& $\SI{1e4}{\poundF}$ \\
		CF 		& puncture 	& $\SI{<100}{\poundF}$	& $\SI{<100}{\poundF}$\\
		delaminated CF 	& axial 	& $\SI{<100}{\poundF}$	& $\SI{<100}{\poundF}$\\

	\end{tabular}
\end{wraptable}

Complete modules were subjected to compressive loads along their axis. This was done by attaching dummy rings, which emulate a connection to another module, and loading the dummy rings through a flat plate. 
The load was slowly increased using a hydraulic press. 
A load cell was used to record the load. The time and corresponding load at which audible pinging occurred was also recorded.
These results can be seen in table \ref{tab:compression}.

%----------talk about pinging/lack of yield----------

%----------what is the actual factor of safety?----------
during launch.

In ultimate failure, both the CF and fiberglass modules failed through buckling of the composite layers at the interface between the inner layer and one of the coupling rings.
This resulted in the composite layers subducting under themselves.
Failure occured uniformly around the inner and outer layers, both at the same distance along the axis of the modules. 

The modules are more suceptible to concentrated surface loading. 
When lateral loading was applied with a $2''$ beam, modules failed below $\SI{100}{\poundF}$. 
The deformation from the beam delaminated the CF layers from the core and eventually tore the outer layer of CF. 
This mode of failure poses a significant threat to the modules when the rocket lands. 
During this phase of the flight, the airframe could impact rocks or bushes, potentially delaminating or puncturing the outer CF layer. 

\section{Nose Cone}\label{sec:noseCone}

To make the nose cone would take significant ingenuity and research into usable materials. The pre-impregnated carbon fiber material donated to us is a material with a 350°F cure cycle. Thus every element used henceforth must survive the same temperature. The initial manufacturing process involved a mandrel and the same procedure as the cylindrical modules. Machine Sciences agreed to donate the material and machine time to create this for PSAS however, lead time prevented them from delivering this to us in the time frame necessary for launch. 

After consideration, it was decided that a work-around method for creating the nose cone would be to use a negative mold. Four high-temperature, 1 inch thick, 18 pound per cubic foot density machinable foam (FR 4718) was purchased and stacked to create a 4 inch thickness. A high-temperature resin coated the blocks to prevent absorption and possible deformation during the cure cycle.

During the first trial layup of the nose cone, it was found that during the cure cycle the foam block fractured at the tip end. This is due to the difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion (α) between the machinable foam and the carbon fiber. The α for the machinable foam is $\SI{48e-6}{\per\kelvin}$ and is larger than the carbon fiber with an α of $\SI{10e-6}{\per\kelvin}$ indicating that the foam contracted faster than the carbon fiber. This created a thermal stress concentration in the tip of the foam block which ultimately fractured the mold. In later iterations of the mold CAM drawing, space was included into the cylindrical base of the cone to allow for the thermal contraction.
