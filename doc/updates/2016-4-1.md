## Materials
Since the last update, we were able to get our new freezer as well as a plug for it. 
On top of that, we rearranged the material in the VMS freezer, our new freezer and the cold room. VMS and our freezer are full.
Alex also got some vacuum bagging peripherals donated, so I think everyone is basically set for materials. 

We still need to clear out the material that's in the biology cold room. That's kind of the only hurdle left for the materials stuff.
Rob and Shawn from VMS both expressed interest in using fiber glass, so we might be able to get rid of some that way.
We gave two big rolls of FG, one small roll of CF, and two small vacuum bag kits to [CTRL-H](http://pdxhackerspace.org/), so that's a little more space.
Erin is also attending a conference where there might be people in need of fiberglass.

##Layup News
LV3 made a layup of a fin module using the new 1515 adhesive and a caul plate. 
The 1515 basically fixed most of the problems with the other layups. There was no wrinkling of the CF or delamination from the nomex or aluminum.
However, there are still a ton of dry fibers on the outer layer. We also had a slight issue with the vacuum bag. 
The tubular bagging material we were using for the inside of the madrel was a little too small, which made the ends of the bag suck in.
This is easily fixed by forming the inner tube from a flat sheet.

The LV4 team is also doing their first layup this Sunday. 
Hopefully we can also put some small test sections in the oven to try and solve this issue with the resin not wetting the outer fibers.

##PSAS biz
OMSI After Dark Happened. There was one guy who worked at Boeing doing manufacturing, so hopefully he will swing by a meeting.
