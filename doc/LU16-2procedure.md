* wet sand the adhering surfaces with 600 grit paper 
* clean all surfaces with acetone 
* continuously apply the anti-galvanic 3M-130 part A to the adhering surfaces for 3 minutes
* continuously apply the anti-galvanic 3M-130 part D to the adhering surfaces for 3 minutes

#Cutting films and fabrics:
* select the appropriate cutting template for the desired film or fabric
* lay the film or fabric over the plastic surface of the work bench
* place the template over the film or fabric
* while one person moderately presses down on the template, another person should cut along the edges with a utility knife
When cutting the overexpanded nomex honeycomb core material, make sure the template is oriented correctly. You should only be cutting single rows of cells (don't cross from one row to another). The overexpanded cells only bend in one direction. Make sure the template is oriented so that the nome will be able to bend around the cylinder. 


#Layup Assembly:
* put on powderless nitrile gloves
* screw the coupling rings into the dummy rings
* without touching the molding surface of the mandrel, slide the ring assemblies on to the mandrel
* screw the dummy rings to the mandrel
* place the mandrel back on the mandrel holder
* lay a layer of blue, perforated release film on the mandrel. It should span the entire molding surface of the mandrel and not overlap with itself or the coupling rings.

* lay the adhesive strips onto the lower adhering surface of each coupling ring. It may be necessary to use spray adhesive to get it to stay on the rings.
* lay the inner layer of carbon fiber onto the mandrel. It should overlap the adhesive strips completely, butting up flush against the step of the rings. It should overlap itself by about an inch.

* lay the inner adhesive layer over the carbon fiber. Rotating the mandrel while someone holds down the adhesive (wear powderless nitrile gloves) works well here.
* once the adhesive is well aligned, peel a section of it back. Someone should still be holding it down. 
* apply a light coating of spray adhesive to the exposed carbon fiber
* roll the adhesive back down onto the carbon fiber
* roll back the remaining adhesive
* apply spray adhesive to the newly exposed carbon fiber
* roll the adhesive film back onto the carbon fiber. There should be no overlap of the adhesive film with itself.
* lay the overexpanded nomex honeycomb core over the mandrel
* perform the same roll-back and spray technique to adhere the nomex to the adhesive film
* scrunch the overlapping portion of the nomex, so that it sits flat on the cylinder
* use the roll-and-spray technique to adhere the outer layer of adhesive film to the nomex. Take care to only apply the spray adhesive to the inner surface of the adhesive film. Applying spray adhesive directly to the nomex is useless. There should be no overlap of the outer adhesive film onto itself.
* use the roll-and-spray technique to apply the outer layer of carbon fiber to the outer layer of adhesive film. There should be about an inch of overlap between the carbon fiber and itself. Take care not to tug on the carbon fiber. When it’s in the oven any deformation to the carbon fiber cloth will relax, forming wrinkles.


#Vacuum bagging:
* lay the outer layer of blue, perforated release film onto the mandrel. It should have about an inch of self-overlap.
* secure the release film with either kapton tape or flash tape
* lay the breather material (“diaper”) over the mandrel
* secure the breather material with either kapton tape or flash tape
* form a 7 inch diameter tube of vacuum bag material by joining a sheet of it along one edge using the yellow vacuum bag tape (“goop tape”). This tube should be at least 1.5 feet longer than the mandrel.
* gently pinch any air channels out of the goop tape
* form a 5.5 inch diameter tube using the same method
* stand the mandrel upright
* slide the larger tube over the mandrel
* slide the smaller tube into the mandrel
* place the mandrel on its side, on the plastic surface of the work bench
* adjust the bags so that they are centered around the mandrel
* using the goop tape, seal one end of the inner tube to the corresponding end of the outer tube
* take care that there is no air channel formed by the overlap of the outer tube with itself
* gently pinch any air bubbles or air channels out of the goop tape
* cover the end of the vacuum hose with diaper, securing it with kapton or flash tape
* place the diaper end of the vacuum hose onto the dummy ring near the open end of the bag
* tape down the hose using kapton or flash tape
* carefully apply goop tape to the vacuum hose, so that it may seal to the tubes
* carefully apply a ring of goop tape to the inner surface of the outer tube
* seal the inner and outer tubes to each other
* gently pinch any air channels out of the goop tape, taking special care to make sure the hose and tubes form a complete seal. Make sure there is no air channel formed by the overlap of the outer tube with itself.

#Curing:
* set up the aluminum (not plastic) mandrel holders in the oven
* thread the vacuum hose through the hole in the oven wall
* gently place the mandrel on the aluminum mandrel holders in the oven, while someone holds them in place
* attach the outside end of the vacuum hose to the venturi pump
* attach the venturi pump to a compressed air supply
* while slowly turning on the compressed air supply, check the bag for hissing (this indicates a leak which must be sealed with goop tape)
* turn the air supply on fully
* arrange the thermocouple to be directly underneath the mandrel
* close and latch the oven
* make sure the oven is plugged into two separate circuit breakers
* make sure both relays on the side of the oven are in the “on” position
* ramp up the the oven at 3 deg F per minute until it reaches 350 deg F
* after it reaches 350 deg F, hold the oven at that temperature for two hours
* ramp down the oven temperature by 5 deg F per hour. Use the oven door to control this cooldown, opening it slightly for faster cooling.


#Removal from mandrel:
* once the oven has reached 100 deg F, open the door and slide vacuum hose into the oven, through the hole in the oven wall, using insulated gloves
* remove the mandrel from the oven using insulated gloves and place it on the mandrel holders on the workbench
* cut open and dispose of the vacuum bag
* remove the hose, diaper, and release film from the mandrel and dispose of them
* place four mandrel removal blocks on the floor
* place the mandrel in the blocks, using insulated gloves
* place a piece of wood on the top of the mandrel
* tap the piece of wood with a hammer to release the mandrel from the module
* with one person holding the mandrel with insulated gloves, gently pull and wiggle the module off the mandrel in the direction of the male ring. Take care not to damage the module or mandrel. If necessary, run cold water through the inside of the mandrel. This will thermally shrink the mandrel, allowing it to slide off easier.
* place the mandrel back on the mandrel holders on the workbench
* remove the blue perforated release film from the inside of the module

#Results:
We developed veins during the curing process. It is believed that this is the result of either the loose vacuum bagging material or the 3M AF30 scotch-weld adhesive. 


#Hypothesis:
Aluminum caul plating will be precisely measured and wrapped around the layup, between the release film and the breather material. Ideally this will distribute the pressure and effects of slack bagging material.
