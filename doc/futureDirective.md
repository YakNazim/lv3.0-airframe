# Directives/recommendations for future work on LV3

## Manufacturing
Making a cylindrical module is't technically difficult. It takes a lot of time and little tricks. If you really know what you're doing, one person can make a module in 10 hours (not counting the machining of the rings, and assuming they have someone to help them lift the CF roll). 

## Materials
Inevitably, the material we accquired will expire or get used up (most likely expire). When this happens, you'll need to accquire more. Your best option is to get it through Boeing. [Loren](loren.m.coleman@boeing.com) and [Sandie](sandie.h.hallman@boeing.com) are the people you need to contact for this. Boeing routinely disposes of lots of material, as itthey require. Most of it is irrelevant, but occasionally they will get rid of composites. You can snag years worth of CF and adhesive this way. The drawback is that there's no guarantee they'll have what you need when you need it. 
You may find yourself in a situation where they're offering you *lots* of material, and you don't know whether or not it's relevant to your project. Be careful about this. We wound up taking lots of material (particularly fiberglass) that we couldn't store. We were able to store lots of it (two freezers full), and give away a lot of the excess to other universities, but two large rolls of FG went to waste. We also ended up annoying the biology department a little bit, by taking up space in their cold room.
Speaking of which, if you find yourself looking for weird aerospace materials or parts, try bugging the WSU rocket team or the OSU robotics lab. We donated lots of material to them, so they kind of owe us a favor.
