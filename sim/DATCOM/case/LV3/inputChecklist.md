# LV3 DATCOM Input Checklist
This is a list of all the inputs that appear in the MiG example. Checked items have been added to the LV3 example. 
The goal here is to get the LV3 example working in the same fashion as the MiG example. 
Right now, I'm still getting NaN for the body drag, lift, et cetera... Maybe reduce the number of stations?
Maybe it's missing some necessary info in FLTCON or SYNTHS?
What happens if I run it with just the body?


# FLTCON

# SYNTHS
- [X] XCG -- longitudinal location of CG,
- [X] ZCG -- vertical location of CG relative to reference plane
- [X] XW -- longitudinal location of theoretical wing apex
- [X] ZW -- vertical location of theoretical wing apex relative to reference plane
- [ ] ALIW -- wing root chord incidence angle measured from reference plane
- [ ] XH -- longitudinal location of theoretical horizontal tail apex
- [ ] ZH -- vertical location of theoretical horizontal tail apex relative to reference plane
- [ ] ALIH -- horizontal tail root chord incidence angle measured from reference plane
- [X] XV -- longitudinal location of theoretical vertical tail apex
- [X] ZV -- vertical location of theoretical vertical tail apex
