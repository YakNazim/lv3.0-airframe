Use these coordinates to draw out one side of the cutout of
the nose cone. So, you will draw some cartesian axes on the 
peel ply of the the CF. Then, plot these points. Then, 
connect the points together. Draw lines between the points
with a straight edge. At the tip, construct the necessary 
unfolding for the doodlybob that connects to the nose tip 
and the nose plug. The units are in inches.
