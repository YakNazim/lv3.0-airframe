I-154	supersonic airfoil designations
	S-3-edgePercentChord-thicknessPercentChord-flatPercentChord
	mean chord = 10.5"
	so, averaged airfoil is:
	S-3-6.2-3.1-87.43

I-116	example problem showing fins similar to those on LV3

I-63	sharp leading edges

interpolated chord as a function of x in the span direction:
	24.642-2.24*x
	so, the theoretical root chord is 24.642"
